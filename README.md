# GlobalCode-HosTech

There is a significant amount of electricity being wasted at our student hostels, So our project seeks to solve this issue by: 

1.Web interface that allows students to login into their room and turn on or off their fan, light etc. 

2.A soner sensor that detects presence at the door and opens the door, then a motion senser picks up your motion and turns on the light, etc.
